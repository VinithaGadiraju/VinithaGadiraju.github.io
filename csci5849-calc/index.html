			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p><b>Welcome!</b>
				<br> 
				You will be using a 3-key switch interface to carry out arithmetic expressions using this calculator. You will start with either your elbow or right hand to perform the expressions. When you are done, you will switch and use the other body part to complete the same expressions again. 
				<br>
				To navigate the app, you may use the following keys:
				Press "h" to move through the items in a row.
				Press "y" to move through the items in a column.
				Press "b" to select a button once you have scrolled to it using the keys listed above.
				<br>
				Use the calculator to perform the following arithmetic expressions: <br>
				3 x 7 <br> 
				12 - 40 <br>
				89 + 7 <br>  
				51 / 6 <br>
				343 - 591 <br>
				482 x 7 <br>

				Be sure to clear the form between each expression! 
			</p>
			<b>Test Results</b> <br>
			<p>
				4 participants took part in the study. All participants were female, grad students, and in their early 20s. All participants did both the elbow and hand trials. 2 participants did the elbow trial first and then the hand trial. 2 participants did the right hand trial first and then the elbow trial.<br>
				All participants spent longer using their elbow than they did using their right hand (see time table below). They also expressed more frustration at using the calculator during the elbow trials (see quotes below).

			<b>Quotes from each participant:</b> <br>
			<b>Participant 1</b>
			<p>
				"This dang spacebar...you should have just used the top row so this wouldn't be a problem." <br>
				"I'm just going to use the h key. Screw the y." <br>
				"*Hits elbow* Ow! This is the worst!" <br>
				"It would just be easier if there were buttons I can slam my elbow into instead of using your keyboard." <br>
				"Frick. This is horrible." <br>
				"There needs to be a back key. This is rough." <br>
			</p>
			<b>Participant 2</b>
			<p>
				"I'm starting to get tired." <br>
				"I can't tell if I'm selecting it or not." <br>
				"I feel like my elbow is becoming my arm." <br>
				"This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life." <br>
			</p>
			<b>Participant 3</b>
			<p>
				"This is very challenging." <br>
				"I think I'm going to do better the second time once I figure out how to navigate this shit." <br>
				"My arm is getting a little tired." <br>
				"It's interesting that once you move through a row it goes to the next row instead of starting over. That f*cked me up." <br>
				"I need a break." <br>
				"I feel dyslexic." <br>
			</p>
			<b>Participant 4</b>
			<p>
				"Hey, I'm kind of bad at this. *Few seconds later* I'm so bad at this." <br>
				"I want to rip my eyeballs out." <br>
				"I'm kind of an idiot...I'm making the same mistakes I did in the beginning with my fingers." <br>
				"I'm going to have so much neck pain tomorrow." <br>
				"This is so much harder than I thought." <br>
				"Holy shat. *Screams in frustration*." <br>
